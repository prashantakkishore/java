 * As in BasicTrie.java there were notion of words or a paragraph where there is word delimiter
 * as space so we can build a Trie . If we have a DNA / protein sequences we dont have space/delimiter
 * to phrase a word like - ababcddddewrye , so create all suffixes and build a compressed Trie, that is
 * a Suffix Tree.
 * 
 * It process the Text rather than pattern.
 *  
 * T = Text 
 * M = Pattern to search
 * Time Complexity : O(M)
 * Space Complexity : O(ALPHABET_SIZE * P * T)
